How it works?
We need to create a server, and put a login plugin that save the passwords in plain text.
If you don't found one, (because most of the login plugins puts the password on a hash), you can add a keylogger plugin.
And once you have the server, you need to use the social engineering to make the victim to register on your server.
And pum! You got the passwords
