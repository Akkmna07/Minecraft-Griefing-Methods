# Ip resolve

First of all, you need to get the ip of the network/server before you perfom a scan.
For that, you can use this command on linux/windows:
ping hypixel.net
In this case, I am tryng to get the hypixel ip.
But remember, avoid scanning this types of ip`s, because their are protected by a fake ip:

104.* (Cloudfare)

81.* (tcp shield)
