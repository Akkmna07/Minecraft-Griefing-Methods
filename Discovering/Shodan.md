# Shodan discovering
[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/dashboard) is a really usefull tool to discover private server.
You can get a big list of minecraft servers around the world.
Also you can make a big search using dorks.
Some shodan works for minecraft servers:
` "Minecraft Server" `
` "BungeeCord" `
` port:25565 country:DE `

For more optimal use, I recommend use the shodan api.
