# Bungee Cord Exploiting
If you are wondering to use the bungee cord protocol to your network, that its a really bad idea.
In this file, I will cover the most exploits that you can use to break this protocol.
Let`s start.

- How bungee hack actually works
- md_5 nickname exploit
- Low security againsÂ´t port scanning 
- Login bypass

### How bungee hack works?

### md_5 nickname exploit
With this nickname, you can get some commands, that a normal user doesn`t have.
For example:
- /alert
- /stop
- /server

### Low security against port scanning
Most of the servers that use bungee cord are realy weak against port scanning. 
They are better alternatives out there than can block some scanners.

### Login Bypass
This only works on bungee cord servers with a bad login configuration.
You need to connect with the owner account, and you will use the /server <modality> to jump into another server without being logged-
And bum! Login bypassed
